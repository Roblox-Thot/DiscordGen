A Discord account gen made in HTML and JS

This will not make working accounts <sub><sub>(as these just get disabled on creation)</sub></sub> but it does send the email to the provided email address so it can be used to mess with people, like teachers or other students. <b>Also the invite is not needed as Discord doesn't even make it join the server anymore.</b>

I will not be supporting this project as discord has changed a lot since I wrote this back on 03/19/2021.  I did recreate it to make it not obfuscated any more but thats the farthest I will go.

## TLDR 

Code fucky, not make acc, no support.
